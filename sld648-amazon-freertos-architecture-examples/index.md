# Communicating with AWS IoT Services using Bluetooth LE and FreeRTOS

**NOTE: This section replaces *AN1362: Communicating with AWS IoT Services using Bluetooth LE and FreeRTOS*. Further updates to this application note will be provided here.**

FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system supported by Amazon as an [open source project](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos). It consists of a snapshot of the FreeRTOS Real-Time Operating System project, as well as a collection of standardized APIs for common MCU peripherals, such as SPI, UART, GPIO, and so on, and wireless connectivity standards, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). Silicon Labs has integrated FreeRTOS components and sample applications into the GSDK, and the Simplicity Studio developer experience. This document summarizes these components and sample applications, and gives an example of how to use the examples to communicate with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud with a smart phone app.
