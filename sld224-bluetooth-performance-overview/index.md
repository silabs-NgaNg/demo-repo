# Performance

This section describes tools to use to help improve performance as well as some performance results.

- [**System Performance**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-system-performance): Addresses a variety of different topics related to improving system performance and reducing power consumption.
- [**EFR32BG SoC Bluetooth Smart Device Power Consumption Measurements**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-efr32bg-smart-device-power-consumption): Describes how to measure the power consumption of EFR32BG devices running the Bluetooth i-Beacon example. For general instructions, see [Measuring Power Consumption in Wireless Gecko Devices](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an969-measuring-power-consumption.pdf).
- [**RF PHY Layer Evaluation in Bluetooth SDK v3.x and Higher**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bt-rf-phy-evaluation-using-dtm-sdk-v3x): Reviews performing radio frequency physical layer evaluation with EFR32BG SoCs and BGM modules using the Direct Test Mode protocol in Bluetooth SDK v3.x.
- [**Bluetooth Low Energy Interoperability Testing Report**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/ble-interop-testing-report): Includes the results of the interoperability testing of Silicon Labs' ICs and Bluetooth Low Energy stack with Android and iOS smart phones.
- [**Bluetooth LE Use Case-Based Low Power Optimization**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-low-power-optimization): Describes how to exploit the different features of Bluetooth technology to achieve the minimum possible energy consumption for a given use case.
