# Non-Volatile Data Storage

This section offers an introduction to non-volatile data storage and describes how to use NVM3 data storage.

- [**Non-Volatile Data Storage Fundamentals**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/non-volatile-data-storage-fundamentals): Introduces non-volatile data storage using flash and the three different storage implementations offered for Silicon Labs microcontrollers and SoCs: Simulated EEPROM, PS Store, and NVM3.
- [**Using Third Generation Non-Volatile Memory (NVM3) Data Storage**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/using-third-generation-nonvolatile-memory): Explains how NVM3 can be used as non-volatile data storage in various protocol implementations.
