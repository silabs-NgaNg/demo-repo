# Bluetooth and Zephyr OS

The Zephyr operating system (OS) is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained and embedded systems.

The [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) describes how to:

- Set up a command-line Zephyr development environment on Ubuntu, macOS, or Windows (instructions for other Linux distributions are discussed in Install Linux Host Dependencies)
- Get the source code
- Build, flash, and run a sample application

A number of Silicon Labs parts support Zephyr development. The [Thunderboard EFR32BG22](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/silabs/dev_kits/sltb010a/doc/index.html) is a low-cost entry point. This page provides information about the part and getting started with Bluetooth development.
