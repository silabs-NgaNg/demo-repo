# System Performance Fundamentals

These pages provide key background information related to improving system performance and reducing power consumption.

- [**Throughput with Bluetooth Low Energy Technology**](./throughput): Describes the maximum achievable bitrates on Blue Gecko devices (EFR32BGxx) with different Bluetooth SDK versions.
- [**Adaptive Frequency Hopping**](./afh): Describes Adaptive frequency hopping, whereby the communicating devices are continuously monitoring their environment for interference and are continuously changing the channel map to address the interference.
- [**Optimizing Current Consumption in Bluetooth Low Energy Devices**](./current-consumption): Discusses ways to reduce power consumption by fine-tuning parameters and configurations related to advertising and connection states.
- [**TX Power Limitations for Regulatory Compliance (ETSI, FCC)**](./compliance-power-limitations): Discusses the rules applied by two main regulatory bodies (ETSI and FCC) and presents how Silicon Labs' Bluetooth stack limits TX power to comply with these regulations.
