# Developing and Debugging Silicon Labs Bluetooth LE Applications

These pages provide details on developing and debugging Bluetooth LE applications. Content
includes:

- [**Silicon Labs Bluetooth C Application Developer's Guide for SDK v7.x and Higher**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-c-soc-dev-guide-sdk-v9x): Covers the Bluetooth stack v7.x architecture, application development flow, using the MCU core and peripherals, stack configuration options, and stack resource usage.
- [**GATT Configurator User's Guide**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/gatt-configurator-users-guide-ble-btmesh): Describes how to use the Simplicity Studio 5 GATT Configurator, an intuitive interface providing access to all the Profiles, Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors as defined in the Bluetooth specification.
- [**Blue Gecko Bluetooth Profile Toolkit Developer's Guide**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-profile-toolkit-developers-guide): Reviews using this XML-based mark-up language to describe the Bluetooth GATT database,configure access and security properties, and include the GATT database as part of the firmware.
- [**Using Network Analyzer with Bluetooth Low Energy and Mesh**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/network-analyzer-with-ble-btmesh): Describes using Simplicity Studio 5's Network Analyzer to debug Bluetooth Mesh and Low Energy applications. It can be read jointly with [**AN958: Debugging and Programming Interfaces for Customer Designs (PDF)**](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an958-mcu-stk-wstk-guide.pdf) for more information on using Packet Trace Interface with custom hardware.
- [**Transitioning from the v2.x to the v3.x Bluetooth SDK (PDF)**](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1255-transitioning-from-bluetooth-sdk-v2-to-v3.pdf): Provides information for those already developing with Bluetooth SDK version 2.x and who are interested in upgrading to the current version.

## Development Tools

**Simplicity Studio and the Simplicity IDE**: Simplicity Studio is the unified development environment for all Silicon Labs technologies, SoCs, and modules. It provides you with access to the target device-specific web and SDK resources, software and hardware configuration tools, and an integrated development environment (IDE) featuring industry-standard code editors, compilers, and debuggers. See the silabs.com [Simplicity Studio page](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio) to download the tools and for more information.

**Bluetooth GATT Configurator**: Bluetooth GATT Configurator, installed with Simplicity Studio, is a simple-to-use tool to help build a customized Bluetooth GATT database for Bluetooth projects. See the [Simplicity Studio User's Guide GATT Configurator section](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-developing-with-project-configurator/bluetooth-gatt-configurator) of the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide for more information.

**Network Analyzer**: Simplicity Studio® 5 (SSv5)'s Network Analyzer enables debugging of complex wireless systems. This tool captures a trace of wireless network activity that can be examined in detail live or at a later time. See the [Simplicity Studio User's Guide Network Analyzer section](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-tools-network-analyzer/) of the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide for more information.

**Wireshark**: Wireshark is the recommended network protocol analyzer for the use with Wi-SUN networks. Download instructions are provided for [Windows/Mac users](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) or [Linux users](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChBuildInstallUnixInstallBins.html). Simplicity Studio® 5 supports [live interaction](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-testing-and-debugging/using-wireshark) between the application running on a Silicon Labs device and Wireshark.

**Energy Profiler**: Simplicity Studio® 5 (SSv5)'s Energy Profiler enables you to visualize the energy consumption of individual devices, multiple devices on one target system, or a network of interacting wireless devices to analyze and improve the power performance of these systems. Real-time information on current consumption is correlated with the program counter providing advanced energy software monitoring capabilities. It also provides a basic level of integration with the Network Analyzer network analysis tool. See the [Simplicity Studio User's Guide Energy Profiler section](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-tools-energy-profiler/) of the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide for more information.

**Simplicity Commander**: Simplicity Commander is a single, all-purpose tool to be used in a production environment. It is invoked using a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) that is also scriptable. Simplicity Commander enables customers to complete essential tasks such as configuring and building applications and bootloaders and flashing images to their devices. Simplicity Commander is available through Simplicity Studio or can be downloaded through [system-specific installers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/mcu-programming-options#programming). The [**Simplicity Commander User's Guide**](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-commander/latest/simplicity-commander-start/) provides more information.

**Silicon Labs Configurator (SLC)**: SLC offers command-line access to application configuration and generation functions. [**Software Project Generation and Configuration with SLC-CLI**]( https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-tools-slc-cli/) provides instructions on downloading and using the SLC-CLI tool.
