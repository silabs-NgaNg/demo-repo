# Developing with Silicon Labs Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)

Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). Designed for data transfer and exchange over short distances, Bluetooth makes use of the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4 GHz. Traditional Bluetooth
technology is optimized for sending a steady stream of high
quality data in a power-efficient way. Bluetooth low energy technology
allows for short bursts of long-range radio connections,
making it ideal for applications that depend on long battery life
and donâ€™t need high throughput streaming data.

Silicon Labs has also developed a library specifically for [Location Services](https://docs.silabs.com/rtl-lib/latest/).

The content on these pages is intended for those who want to experiment with or are already developing a Bluetooth LE application using Silicon Labs technology.

**For details about this release**: Links to release notes are available on the [silabs.com SDK Release Notes page](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/software-development-kit-release-notes).

**For Silicon Labs Bluetooth LE product information**: See the [product pages on silabs.com](https://www.silabs.com/wireless/bluetooth).

**For background about the Bluetooth protocol**: The [Fundamentals section](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-fundamentals-overview) is a good place to start.

**To get started with development**: See the [Getting Started section](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-getting-started-overview) to get started working with example applications.

**If you are already in development**: See the [Developer's Guide](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-developers-guide-overview) for details or go directly to the [Stack API Reference Guide](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-stack-api) or [Service API Reference Guide](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-service-api).

**If you are using Bluetooth LE SDK version 2.x**, see [Transitioning from the v2.x to the v3.x Bluetooth SDK](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1255-transitioning-from-bluetooth-sdk-v2-to-v3.pdf).
