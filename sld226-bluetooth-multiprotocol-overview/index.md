# Bluetooth LE in Multiprotocol Applications

This section provides background information on multiprotocol applications, and details on using Bluetooth in multiprotocol applications, including dynamic multiprotocol and concurrent multiprotocol models.

- [**Multiprotocol Fundamentals**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/multiprotocol-fundamentals): Describes the four multiprotocol modes, discusses considerations when selecting protocols for multiprotocol implementations, and reviews the Radio Scheduler, a required component of a dynamic multiprotocol solution.
- [**Dynamic Multiprotocol User's Guide**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/multiprotocol-dynamic-ug): Describes how to implement a dynamic multiprotocol solution.
- [**Dynamic Multiprotocol Development with BLE and Proprietary Protocols on RAIL**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/multiprotocol-dynamic-ble-proprietary-on-rail): Provides details on how to develop a dynamic multiprotocol application running Bluetooth and a proprietary protocol on RAIL in GSDK v3.x.
- [**Running Zigbee, OpenThread, and Bluetooth Concurrently on a Linux Host with a Multiprotocol RCP**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/multiprotocol-solution-linux): Describes how to run any combination of Zigbee EmberZNet, OpenThread, and Bluetooth networking stacks on a Linux host processor, interfacing with a single EFR32 Radio Coprocessor (RCP) with multiprotocol and multi-PAN support.
