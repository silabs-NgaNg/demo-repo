# Coexistence

This section describes implementing managed coexistence to improve coexistence of Bluetooth with other protocol traffic.

- [**Wi-Fi Coexistence Fundamentals**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/multiprotocol-wifi-coexistence-fundamentals): Introduces methods to improve the coexistence of 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and other 2.4 GHz radios such as Bluetooth, Bluetooth Mesh, and Bluetooth Low Energy with IEEE 802.15.4-based radios such as Zigbee and OpenThread.
- [**Bluetooth Coexistence with Wi-Fi**](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-coexistence-with-wifi): Describes the Wi-Fi impact on Bluetooth and methods to improve Bluetooth coexistence with Wi-Fi. Explains design considerations to improve coexistence without direct interaction between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios. These techniques are applicable to the EFR32MGx and EFR32BGx series. Discusses the Silicon Labs Packet Traffic Arbitration (PTA) support to coordinate 2.4GHz RF traffic for co-located Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios.
