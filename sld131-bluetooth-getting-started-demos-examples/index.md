# More Demos and Examples

Because starting application development from scratch is difficult, the Bluetooth SDK comes with a number of built-in demos and examples covering the most frequent use cases, as shown in the following figure. Demos are pre-built application images that you can run immediately. Software examples (example projects) can be modified before building the application image. See [Getting Started with Application Development](/bluetooth/{build-docspace-version}/bluetooth-getting-started-app-dev) for more information about configuring and customizing examples.

Demos with the same name as examples are built from their respective example. Click **View Project Documentation** to see additional information about some examples. This is also displayed on a **readme** tab when you create a project based on the example.

Use the **Demos** and **Example Projects** switches to filter on only examples or only demos. Demos are also noted by the blue Demo tag in the upper left of the card. The Solution Examples are primarily for use with multiprotocol applications.

>**Note**: The demos and examples you see are determined by the part selected. If you are using a custom solution with more than one part, click on the part you are working with to see only the items applicable to that part.
